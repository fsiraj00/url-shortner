# url-shortner
a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page.

To run this, follow these simple steps:

1. Press the green button "Code" and download files as a zip. Save them locally in a folder.
2. Open the folder that has all the files (manage.py,urlshortner,templates,shortner, etc) in VSCODE
3. Open Command Prompt and download django ('pip install django' or 'pip3 install django' for mac). For me 'python -m pip install django' works.
4. CD to where you saved the project (directory with manage.py)
5. in command prompt enter 'python manage.py runserver'
6. Open the link it shows in the terminal on a web browser
7. Now you can use the application, simply enter a url (without https://) and click on the Shorten button. 
8. Copy paste the link into your browser and you should be redirected there.
